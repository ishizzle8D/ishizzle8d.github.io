        <h1 class="font-weight-light">About Us!</h1>
        <p>From the inception of Tomahawk Construction in 2004, the company was created to provide construction services
            in site preparation and grading. Initial services that were provided for both residential and commercial
            construction included land clearing, grading of land, and the import/export of embankment materials. The
            company continues to offer these initial services as well as other services that enhance the concept of the
            total site package. New site work offerings include roadway construction, underground utility construction,
            mass earthwork operations, and the processing of excavated materials</p>

                    <h1>Clearing</h1>
                    <p>
                        Clearing is generally the first step in the development of raw land. It goes without saying that
                        a successful clearing job can set the tone for the rest of the project. Clearing consists of the
                        cutting, removal, and satisfactory disposal of all vegetation and debris. This is done in
                        advance of excavation and embankment operations. Proper clearing and grubbing techniques are
                        essential when constructing engineered embankments on a project.


                        Tomahawk Construction takes great effort in considering the environmental impact of clearing.
                        Installation of temporary or permanent erosion control measures are initiated prior to any land
                        disturbing activities. These practices minimize the impact of soil erosion on the environment.
                        Environmentally sensitive areas are given special consideration. All clearing debris is properly
                        disposed of in accordance with all local, State and Federal regulations.


                        Tomahawk Construction is capable of providing clearing services that range from upland forests
                        to swampy marshlands. Each project is evaluated on its own individual merits. The scopes of
                        environmentally sensitive areas that include hand clearing or selected tree removal are
                        assessed. Clearing methods such as haul off, burn boxes, waste disposal sites, and merchantable
                        timber are a few of the considerations that are evaluated for economic impact to the client.</p>

                    <h1>Earthwork</h1>
                    <p>
                        The term Earthwork includes a broad range of construction activities but can generally be
                        described as excavations (cuts) and embankments (fills) for roadways and associated site
                        development. This is a core competency at the heart of Tomahawk Construction and the center from
                        which other competencies have evolved.


                        The ultimate goal of earthwork construction is to make the final product look and function as
                        the designer intended, but beneath the aesthetic qualities of the finished product are the
                        technical aspects of earthwork. Considerations about soil properties, soil identification and
                        classification of materials are essential to analyzing the economic prospects of each project.
                        Tomahawk Construction has the personnel, knowledge, and experience to explore available options
                        in earthwork construction.


                        Whether your project consists of grading small parcels of land or moving millions of cubic yards
                        of earth, Tomahawk Construction can provide superior quality projects that are on time and
                        within budget.</p>

                    <h1>Rock Excavation</h1>
                    <p>
                        Subsurface geologic rock formations are frequently encountered in Southwest Florida. One facet
                        of the earthwork industry involves the excavation of this rock. Rock excavation is typically
                        defined as excavation which cannot be accomplished with the equipment normally used in the
                        course of excavation.

                        Contractors often view rock excavation to be challenging. Rock excavation can be accomplished by
                        a variety of techniques. These techniques include but are not limited to blasting, trenching,
                        ripping, and hammering. Considerations as to weathering, strength, and fracturing of the rock
                        are used to determine the best technique. Blasting is generally the most cost effective method
                        to remove hard rock but project restrictions such as proximity and regulatory permitting may be
                        prohibitive.

                        Choosing the most cost effective approach to rock excavation is vital to a projectâ€™s success.
                        Cost, time and excavation rates can vary greatly depending in the method of rock excavation.
                        Tomahawk Construction has the experience and knowledge to properly assess these rock
                        considerations.</p>

                    <h1>Rip Rap</h1>
                    <p>
                        Tomahawk Construction has installed miles of rip rap to protect the shoreline in Southwest
                        Florida. Rip Rap is a type of slope protection that is typically used where the earth and water
                        meet. Rip Rap also helps to stabilized the embankment and minimize the effects of erosion. The
                        experience that Tomahawk Construction has in the installation of rip rap adds to the aesthetic
                        value as well as the engineering value that this type of slope protection offers.</p>

                    <p>
                        Sometimes it is possible to take a bad situation and make it good, or at least better. If a
                        project has too much of one type of material and not enough of another, Tomahawk Construction
                        will look at innovative ways to resolve these dilemmas. Material processing is one method that
                        offers a cost savings approach to the typical site development project.</p>

                    <p>
                        Roadways are something that can be seen well after the construction project is over. That is why
                        they must be constructed with the utmost care and quality. Tomahawk Construction has the
                        experienced personnel to complete every phase of road building construction.</p>
